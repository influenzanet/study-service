# Study Actions

This document describes the currently available study actions provided by CASE.

 Study actions are performed by using the following collection of `struct` objects as parameters:

* `action` : an object of `types.Expression`. Specifies the actions that should be performed.
* `oldState` : an object of `types.ParticipantState`. Characterizes the current state of the participant that will potentially be updated by evaluating the action expression.
* `event` : an object of `types.StudyEvent`. Specifies the event that was triggered by the participant or by the program (e.g. `"TIMER"`) and collects the survey responses,
* `dbService` : an object of `types.StudyDBService`. References the database abstraction layer to get access to previous responses of the participant (for example to check them for conditions specified by the researcher).

The functions executing actions are listed in the following.
The header denotes the string keyword leading to the decision which kind of action will be performed. The block code indicates the header of the function that will be executed in case of the keyword specified.

## 1.  IF

This function is used for control flow implementing the typical if-else structure. Conditions are checked in order to decide which actions will be performed.

Functional description:
```
IF(condition, action[, action_else])
```

Go Implementation:
```go
ifAction(action, oldState, event, dbService)
```

**Required Parameter:**

>   `action.Data[0]` :  condition, evaluated to a boolean value \
>   `action.Data[1]` : perform this action if condition is true  \
>   `action.Data[2]` :  (optional) perform this action otherwise


 **Note:** If the execution of action fails, the old state of the participant is returned unmodified. The length of `action.Data` must be at least 2.

**Return:** `(types.ParticipantState, error)`


### 2. DO

Performs a list of actions by iterating through the `action.Data` argument. This function can be used to group actions together as a defined list of arguments.

Functional description:
```
DO(action...)
```

Go Implementation:
```go
doAction(action, oldState, event, dbService)
```

**Required Parameters:**

>   `action.Data[0:]` :  list of actions that will be performed successively

**Return:** `(types.ParticipantState, error)`


### 3. IFTHEN

Conditionally performs a list of actions. The function checks the first argument as condition deciding if actions will be performed. In case of `true` it iterates through the following entries arguments.

Functional description:
```
IFTHEN(condition, actions...)
```

Go Implementation:
```go
ifThenAction(action, oldState, event, dbService)
```

**Required Parameters:**

>   `action.Data[0]` :  condition, evaluated to a boolean value \
>   `action.Data[1:]` : perform this sequence of actions if condition is true

 **Note:** The length of `action.Data` must be at least 1.

**Return:** `(types.ParticipantState, error)`


## 4. UPDATE_STUDY_STATUS

Updates the status of the participant (e.g. from active to inactive). Possible status values: "active", "temporary", "exited". Other values are possible and are handled like "exited" on the server.

Functional description:
```
UPDATE_STUDY_STATUS(status)
```

Go Implementation:
```go
updateStudyStatusAction(action, oldState, event)
```


**Required Parameter:**

>   `action.Data[0]` : the new status of the participant convertible to `string`. Possible values are: `"active"`, `"temporary"`, `"exited"`. Other values are possible and are handled like `"exited"` on the server.


 **Note:**
 The length of `action.Data` must be 1.

**Return:** `(types.ParticipantState, error)`

## 5. START_NEW_STUDY_SESSION

Generates an ID for a new study session as unique string. This ID is stored for all subsequent survey responses of one single participant. The conditions when to call this method are defined in the respective study rules. For example, in the tekenradar study a new ID is generated by starting a new PDiff survey outside a follow up flow.
